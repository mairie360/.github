# 🚀 **Feature Development Process**  

## 📌 1. Feature Planning  

- **Create a GitHub Issue**:  
  - Open a new **GitHub issue** for the feature.  
  - Clearly describe the feature, including:  
    - 📝 **Summary**: What the feature does.  
    - ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements the feature must meet.  
    - 📎 **Additional Details**: Attach mockups, references, or diagrams.  
  - Assign the issue to a milestone (refer to **Collaboration.md** for naming conventions).  

---

## 🎨 2. Design & Approval  

- **💬 Design Discussion**:  
  - Discuss feature requirements, technical details, and UX design in **Microsoft Teams** or **Discord Server**.
  - For features requiring UI/UX work, share **mockups** or **diagrams** for review.  

- **✅ Approval**:  
  - Once the design and approach are finalized, mark the issue as **Ready to Start** and move it to the **To-Do** column in the **GitHub Project Board**.

## 💻 3. Development  

- **🌿 Branch Creation**:  
  - Create a feature branch with a clear name (refer to **Collaboration.md** for naming conventions).  

- **🛠️ Implementation**:  
  - Write the code, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met.  
  - Commit frequently with **descriptive commit messages** (Refer to **Version_Control.md**).  

- **📌 Task Tracking**:  
  - Move the issue to **In Progress** on the **GitHub Project Board**.

## 🔀 4. Pull Request (PR)  

- **📤 Submit the PR**:  
  - Open a **pull request** from the feature branch to the main development branch (**develop** or **main**).  
  - Use a **PR template** and include:  
    - 📝 **Description**: What the feature does and its impact.  
    - 🔗 **Linked Issue**: Reference the GitHub issue (*Closes #123*).  
    - 🔬 **Testing Steps**: Instructions to verify the feature.  
    - 📷 **Screenshots**: Attach relevant images or outputs.  

- **🧐 Code Review**:  
  - Assign **reviewers** to check for quality, standards compliance, and bugs.  
  - Address **reviewer feedback** promptly and update the PR as needed.  

- **⚙️ Automated & Manual Testing**:  
  - Ensure the feature passes **automated CI tests** (unit tests, integration tests).  
  - Conduct **manual testing** for edge cases and usability.  

---

## 🚀 5. Merging & Deployment  

- **🔗 Merge the PR**:  
  - Once approved and all tests pass, ask the project manager to merge the PR.  
  - The related issue will be **automatically closed** upon merging.  

- **🛠️ Staging Deployment**:  
  - Deploy the feature to a **staging environment** for further validation.  

---

## 🎯 6. Production Release  

- **🚀 Deployment**:  
  - Release the feature to production during a **scheduled deployment window**.  
  - Monitor the release to ensure smooth functionality.  

- **🔍 Post-Release Validation**:  
  - Verify the feature in production and address any immediate issues.  

- **📚 Documentation**:  
  - Update relevant project documentation:  
    - 📖 **User guides or FAQs**.  
    - 📄 **API or system documentation** (if applicable).
