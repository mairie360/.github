# 🔍 **Code Review Process: Ensuring Quality Before Merging**

A structured **code review process** ensures code quality, maintainability, and consistency before merging changes into the main branch.

## 🚀 1. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  

Once a feature is complete, the developer submits a **Pull Request (PR)** for review.  

✅ **Action Steps:**  
- Push the branch to the repository.  
- Open a PR against the `main` branch.   
- Add a **clear description** summarizing:  
  - The problem solved.  
  - The approach taken.  
  - Any potential impact or dependencies.  
- Link the PR to any **related issue** (if applicable).

## 📋 2. **Automated Checks Before Review**  

Before manual review, automated checks must pass to ensure baseline quality.  

Wait them to pass before requesting a review.

## 🧐 3. **Review Code for Quality & Best Practices**  

A reviewer examines the code for quality, readability, and adherence to best practices.  

### **What to Look for in a Review:**  
🔹 **Code Clarity**: Is the code easy to understand? Are variable/function names meaningful?  
🔹 **Best Practices**: Does the code follow SOLID principles, DRY, KISS?  
🔹 **Efficiency**: Are there unnecessary loops, redundant calculations, or complex logic?  
🔹 **Security**: Are there any security flaws (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded credentials)?  
🔹 **Tests**: Are there sufficient tests for edge cases and expected behavior?  
🔹 **Documentation**: Are functions/classes well-documented?  

✅ **Action Steps:**  
- Leave **constructive comments** with suggestions.  
- Approve or request changes using.  
- Highlight any **critical issues** that must be fixed before merging.

## 🔄 4. **Request Changes & Iterate**

- Address all requested changes.  
- Push the updates to the same branch (PR auto-updates).  
- Reply to reviewer comments with explanations (if needed).  
- Re-run **tests** and **linters** after changes.

## ✅ 5. **Approve & Merge the PR**  

Once all issues are resolved, the reviewer approves the PR for merging.
