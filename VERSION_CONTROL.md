Managing project versions is crucial for maintaining clear and organized workflows. Below is a structured guide on how to handle versioning and commit conventions effectively.

## 🚀 1. **Commit Types**

When making commits, it’s important to follow standardized commit types. This will help the team understand the purpose of a commit at a glance.

### Commit Types:  
- **`Feat`**: A new feature or functionality.
- **`Fix`**: A bug fix.
- **`Docs`**: Documentation changes or updates.
- **`Style`**: Code style changes (spacing, formatting, etc.).
- **`Refactor`**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- **`Perf`**: Performance improvements.
- **`Test`**: Adding or updating tests.
- **`Chore`**: Maintenance tasks, updates, or other minor changes.

✅ **Action Steps:**
- Use the appropriate commit type to label your changes.
- Include a short and descriptive message after the type.
- Follow the format: `<type>: <message>`

## ✏️ 2. **Writing Effective Commit Messages**

### Format:  
- **`<type>: <message>`**

### Example:  
- **`Feat: add login functionality`**
- **`Fix: resolve click issue`**
- **`Docs: update installation instructions`**

✅ **Action Steps:**
- Ensure the commit message is clear and describes what and why changes were made.
- Limit the message to **50-72 characters** on the first line, followed by a blank line and more details if necessary.
